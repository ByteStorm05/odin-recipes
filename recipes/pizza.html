  <h1>Pizza Margherita – Neapolitan Style</h1>
  <img src="../images/pizza.jpeg" alt="" width="500px">
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 9-oz. balls Master Pizza Dough</li>
    <li>All-purpose flour, for work surface</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons crushed tomatoes, divided</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
    <li>4 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced, divided</li>
    <li>Fresh basil leaves, for serving</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions:</h2>

<ol >
    <li>Place dough balls on a baking sheet; cover with plastic wrap. Let rest at room temperature for at least 45 minutes and up to 2 hours. (This will make it easier to stretch.)
    </li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 525°F with racks in uppermost and lowest positions. Lightly flour a work surface. Place 1 dough ball on surface (leave second ball covered); turn to coat in flour. Press firmly with fingertips and palm to flatten to an 8-inch round, starting from the center and working toward the edge. With hands at 10 and 2 o’clock, lift dough and rotate, moving hands around the edge, letting dough stretch to a 10-inch round. Transfer to a baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Spread 2 tablespoons crushed tomatoes over dough, leaving a 1-inch border. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil and top with half the cheese.</li>
    <li>Bake on lower rack until bottom of crust is browned (use a spatula to peek underneath), 7 to 9 minutes. Transfer to top rack; increase oven temperature to broil. Watching closely, broil until crust is lightly charred, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from oven; top with basil.</li>
    <li>Repeat with remaining dough and toppings.</li>
</ol>
